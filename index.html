<h2 align="center">Trisha Rohlfs - Assignment 3, IT325</h2>

<h5 class="iam">I WILL</h5><p>As a student at Old Dominion University, <b>I will</b> graduate with my Accounting degree in December of 2019!   <a href="https://www.odu.edu/">ODU link</a></p>

<h5 class="iam">I SHOULD</h5><p>I cook and bake because <b>I should</b> since I am a mother of 3 and my family needs healthy meals. I spend crazy amounts of hours looking for recipes, shopping, and trying to create whatever I see in those delicious recipe photos. Sometimes I hit the mark but not as much as I would like.   <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">All Recipes link</a></p>


<h5 class="iam">I LOVE</h5><p><b>I love</b> to garden! My husband and I even bought a home that sits on one acre in Virginia Beach by Lake Smith so we can have space to garden (and for our children to enjoy the outdoors). Most of our plants in our yard are eatables. We have orchard trees, berry bushes, herbs, and vegetable gardens.   <a href="pageTwo4.html">My Garden</a></p>
