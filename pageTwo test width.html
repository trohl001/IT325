    <td><b>FRUIT TREES - </b>We have 10 fig, 6 peach, 2 plum, and 2 cherry trees. I am hoping to plant 2 apple trees this spring.
	Dry figs and fig jam are amazing!! Fig trees are easy to care for here in Virginia Beach but all the other fruit trees take a lot of love and watchful eyes.
	We try to use natural solutions for pest control but it's a lot of work and I need to admit the pest might be winning the battle.

     <td><b>BERRIES AND GRAPES - </b>We have 15 blueberry, 15 blackberry, and 10 red rasberry bushes.
 	We also have a strawberry patch, kiwi vines and 5 grapevines. The berry bushes have been very succesful! We have fresh berries of one
	type or another from late April to late December! We eat the berries fresh, make jams, freeze for smoothies, and share with friends.

    <td><b>VEGETABLE GARDENS - </b>We always have a summer garden and try to have a spring and fall garden but haven't quite made it that far. 
	We have tried many different types of vegetables. Our main vegtables are tomatoes, green peppers, cucumbers, spinich, lettuce, carrots, 
	onions, parsnips, sweet peas, beans, and corn. Three years ago I planted asperagus and this spring will be our first harvest! I'm really excited!

<tr>
    <td><b>HERBS - </b>We have most of the basic herbs planted. Most come up year after year. Others we plant each spring.
	My favorites are chives, dill, cilantro, and basil. Every year I tried to utilize the herbs more and plant more variety.
	I need to start drying the herbs. Right now I just use them fresh.
